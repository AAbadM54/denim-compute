#Workflow development

This section covers the BAW development items of interest. Before looking at this section, it is recommended to first be familiar with the [workflow design](../design/workflow.md). To follow along in this section, it helps to have the solution installed as described in the [Deploy](../showtime/deploy-solution.md) section.

This section is sub-divided into the following chapters:

- [Process flow control](./process-flow-control.md) which covers the BPMN processes and how they co-ordinate the process logic.
- [Process services](./process-services.md) which covers the process activities implemented as *service flows*.
- [Process user interface](./process-user-interface.md) which covers the user task implementations within a process that use *client-side human services* and *coaches*.
- [Case activities](./case-activities.md) which covers the *case activity* implementations.
- [Case user interface](./case-user-interface.md) which covers the user task implementations within case activities.
- [Workflow for emulated BAI](./bai-emulated-workflow.md) which covers the specific workflow implementation used to allow for emulation of data loads into Business Automation Insights (BAI).
