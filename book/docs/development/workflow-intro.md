#Workflow development

This section covers the BAW development items of interest. Before looking at this section, it is recommended to first be familiar with the [workflow design](../../design/workflow). To follow along in this section, it helps to have the solution installed as described in the [Deploy](../../showtime/deploy-solution) section.

This section is sub-divided into the following chapters:

- [Process flow control](../process-flow-control) which covers the BPMN processes and how they co-ordinate the process logic.
- [Process services](../process-services) which covers the process activities implemented as *service flows*.
- [Process user interface](../process-user-interface) which covers the user task implementations within a process that use *client-side human services* and *coaches*.
- [Case activities](../case-activities) which covers the *case activity* implementations.
- [Case user interface](../case-user-interface) which covers the user task implementations within case activities.
