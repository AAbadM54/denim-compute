#Operational intelligence
The [Business Automation Insights](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYHZ8_18.0.x/com.ibm.dba.bai/topics/con_bai_intro.html) (BAI) component provides capabilities to visualize the business events that are generated by an automation solution, as well as feed these events to a data lake so that deeper insights can be derived about the solution, in particular by applying machine learning algorithms to the events.

In the following sections, we describe how BAI is put to work for the different components of the Denim Compute solution.

## ODM dashboard
The Denim Compute implementation uses ODM events collected by BAI to present a Kibana dashboard that shows the distribution of the different business decision outcomes over a period of time.

- For the *claim segmentation* decision, the visualization is the portion of low (green), medium (orange) and high (red) complexity claims processed in past period.

- For *escalation review*, the portion of escalated claims (dark blue) versus the claims that do not need escalation (light blue) is displayed.

- For *fraud assessment*, the fraud median score as well as the maximum score over the past period is displayed.

A sample view of this dashboard is shown below.

The dashboard is created following the steps in [this tutorial]( https://github.com/ODMDev/decisions-bai-gettingstarted/blob/master/gs_topics/tut_bai_gs_custom_lsn.md), using the following ODM output parameters fields to build the search:

| Decision | Target Kibana field | BOM attribute |
| -------- | ------------------- | ------------- |
| Assess Fraud | `data.claim_processing.assess_fraud.out.fraud.score` | `FraudAssessment.score` |
| Review Escalation | `data.claim_processing.review_escalation.out.escalation.required` | `EscalationAssessment.required` |
| Segment Claim | `data.claim_processing.segment_claim.out.complexity.complexity` | `ComplexityAssessment.complexity` |
