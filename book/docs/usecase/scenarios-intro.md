# Scenarios introduction

The following sub-sections have been created to illustrate various "day in the life" scenarios. You should start with the [Main scenario](/usecase/resources/denim-compute-scenario-walkthrough.pdf) which is an end-to-end scenario showing the use of the Business Automation Workflow (BAW) and its integraton with Operational Decision Management (ODM) for automobile insurance claims processing.

From there, if you are interested in how to extend the scenario with Business Automation Content Analyzer (BACA), see the [BACA scenario](/usecase/baca-scenario-walkthrough/). If you are interested in how to extend the scenario with Business Automation Insights (BAI), see the [BAI scenario](/usecase/bai-scenario-walkthrough/).
